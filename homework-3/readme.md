   ### Working with p5.js

  Sketching with p5.js is a *lot* more difficult than drawing regularly. I feel like I have to have an understanding of graphing in order to do this. The problem that I had was understanding where to place things in relation to each other. I ended up using a lot of push, pop, and translate to get my objects in the right place.

  ### Steps in the Process

  Here are some images from the process.

  Overall, I enjoyed the project even though i struggled at times.
