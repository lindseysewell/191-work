# Classes

I had a lot of trouble this week, but I am beginning to understand classes. My main problem as usual was overthinking and using the wrong order for calling things. I didn't call my class ahead of my sketch.js file at first. Also, there is another class file called class2 in my index.html, but it doesn't seem to mess anything up. (I had been trying to add another effect but I gave up when it broke my already functioning code too many times)
