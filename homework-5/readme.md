# Homework 5

  This assignment was daunting for me. I'm not sure if I'm completely satisfied with the results. I utilized the resources, which helped a lot, but I still have a lot to learn.

  ## Successes

  I was fairly satisfied with the way the bubbles have a section of green/blue, a section of red/purple, and a crossover section.

  I realized after I finished that with practice, I could probably make it look like I'm generating outer space rather than just bubbles. I might try that some time.


  ## Issues
  I need to better understand the purpose of modulo and other math sequences.
