# Interacting Objects #

For this assignment, I needed a lot of help so I referenced a lot of in-class projects. I didn't want to just have bouncing balls so I decided to make a bunch of ladybugs interacting with each other. They kind of look like bumper cars, hence the "bumper bugs." I would have liked to be a little bit more complex but I did what I could with my current understanding and a lot of review.
